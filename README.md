# TLM_GPT
A tiny language model trained on tiny stories (tiny_story.txt). Feel free to play with it with other corpora. 

Build_GPT_4_words_50k_iters.ipynb - has a working sample, this one can be rerun if you like (after cloning). The example result is also included in the repo. 

Build_GPT_4_words_50k_iters_annotated.ipynb - this is my attempt (with an assist from Claude Code) to rewrite the above code with annotations and add more testing stuff at the end. Might have factual inaccuracies because some of the testing code has been Claude-generated. I will be checking and will update with a confirmed working version as soon as the training cycle completes.
